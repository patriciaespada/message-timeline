# Message timeline application

# Dependencies:
* Sails.js
* MongoDB
* AngularJS 1.6.9
* Bootstrap 3.3

# How to run:
* Compile server dependencies with: `npm install`
* Compile front-end dependencies with: `bower install`
* Start mongodb instance with: `mongod`
* Start app with: `npm start`

# Instructions:
The aim of the task is to create a simple single-page application allowing users to create a message timeline where
users post and reply to messages. The frontend part should be developed using AngularJS 1.5+ and Twitter Bootstrap, the backend using Sails node.js framework and a MongoDB database. The backend should be kept as simple as possible to provide the necessary functions but more complex functions such as user authentications, sessions and anything unrelated to the task should be omitted.

The application should show a list (timeline) of messages and provide users' the ability to add new messages to
the timeline or comment on existing messages. The form should be kept simple, allowing users to post new messages with a user name and simple text message. Each message in the timeline should display who wrote the message, when the message was sent and the content of the message itself.

_Technology requirements:_
* AngularJS 1.5/1.6
* Bootstrap 3.3

_Resources:_
* AngularJS introduction tutorial is a great way to get started: https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial
* AngularJS API documentation is a must: https://docs.angularjs.org/api
* Bootstrap documentation: http://getbootstrap.com/
* For an overall view of backend+frontend dev using Sails and angular, the sailsCast screencast is a great way to get started: http://irlnathan.github.io/sailscasts/
* John papa Angular style guide https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide

_Assessment:_
* Overall quality of the code (style, comments, ...)
* Design of the REST API
* Use of Angular best practices (components, directives, filters, controllerAs, form validation)
